### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to add icons into my projects and give them a hover interaction.

```css
div.ic:hover {
	color: var(--sMagenta);
	border-color: var(--sMagenta);
}
```

### Questions

- I wasn't able to fit the background image perfectly and was wondering if using the cover position was better so that it won't look bad in smaller screens

### Useful resources

- [Build a Responsive Grid CSS Website Layout From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - This helped me understand how to use grids and flexbox to organize my website. I also learned about some new vs code extentions such as prettier which helped make my code look neat and organised.
